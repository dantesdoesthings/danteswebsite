<h3>What's on this site?</h3>
This site holds a few <a href="{% url 'projects' %}">projects</a> I've put together to give a sample of my experience.
<br>
The source code for the site, including these projects, is available at <a href="https://github.com/dantesdoesthings/danteswebsite">my github.</a>
<h3>How was this site made?</h3>
This entire site, like all of these projects, was written by me.
Some code was created following tutorials, how-tos, and descriptions on the web, with changes made as needed.
<br>
Inspiration, help, and troubleshooting was provided by friends, family, and, of course, helpful anonymous people all over the internet.
